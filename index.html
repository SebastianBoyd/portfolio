In the knowledge and thinking section I progressed from a 90% to 100% in my sold reading journal. I could improve my oral communication, on the PK presentation I got 90%. My collaboration score in the last project was 100%. My agency score was 95%. I am above proficient in all my learning outcomes so I just need to keep doing what I am doing. To get my oral communication score up I will practice more before the next presentation.

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He just finished 5 hours of homework after an exhausting day. He collapsed on the couch and opened Netflix. Dirty laundry scattered the floor. He knew there were one thousand things to do but he just needed a break. There was no time for exercise, or just to eat a healthy dinner. This is the life of one overworked high school student among millions around the world.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise is a vital part of any person&rsquo;s life and is especially important for teens. Exercising leads to higher grades, better mental function, and reduced stress. Drake students still are not getting enough exercise. It is important to exercise regularly as a teen because what people do as a teenager can have huge effects on the rest of their lives. (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaney</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2015) People who exercised a lot when they were younger are much more likely to continue throughout the rest of their life. Thousands of years ago people got their exercise by working hard all day hunting animals or working in the fields but modern life in a wealthy country no longer requires this. Someone could easily go their entire life without ever exercising and still be very successful. People evolved to handle physical labor all day and life without it destroys people&rsquo;s health. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sir Francis Drake High School is located in the affluent county of Marin. Although Marin is known for being very healthy and has one of the longest life expectancies in the country, its exercise rates are below recommendations. Last week I talked with someone trying to change that, Doug Donnellan. He is a P.E. at Drake for many years. He spends every day teaching teens about exercise. We met under the fluorescent lighting if the main gym at the high school where he told me his many thoughts on exercise.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also talked to Leo Krashanoff, a Drake student on the mountain biking team, to get a teen&rsquo;s unique perspective on exercise. He talked about how it is largely the responsibility of teens to motivate themselves and commit to regular exercise. Leo said it is important for people to the support of their friends because they can be great motivators to exercise. He also can speak from personal experience about exercise&rsquo;s benefits &ldquo;Exercise reduces my stress and makes it easier for me to focus in school&rdquo; (Krashanoff, 2015)</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Drake High School, students have a lot of work to do to meet the targets for exercise. With less than half of students meeting exercise targets. Drake is a school where most students go to college and there is a lot of pressure to do well in school. All this stress and lack of time can lead people to give up on part of their life. Often that essential part is exercise. Exercise even help reduce the stress that can prevent it from happening. Only 54% of freshmen and 46% of juniors at Drake get at least 30 minutes of exercise 5 days a week. (WestEd, 2014) It is recommended that teens get 60 minutes of exercise 7 days a week. (CDC, 2015) Our society needs to make a big change to how the health of teens is treated.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the people not meeting exercise goals are not playing sports. (Donnellan, 2015) Some people just don&rsquo;t want to or don&rsquo;t have the time to play sports. That is okay but &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sports&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be an excuse to not exercise. There are plenty of other ways to get exercise and it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is important for all people. Anyone can go hiking, jogging or go to a gym. &nbsp;Focus needs to be on this group most specifically because they need the opportunity to have an active lifestyle.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their junior and senior years many students are under much more academic stress and have very little time. They are massively over scheduled every single day. In one day they go to school for 7 hours, complete several hours of homework, spend time with friends, eat and get too little sleep. Many must feel they simply have no time to do any exercise. Even if they have a little time where they could fit in some exercise they feel that it wouldn't be worth it to exercise for so little time. While it is better to get more exercise, for people that really don&rsquo;t have the time there are several different short workouts. Research shows that some workouts, as little as one minute, can have huge health benefits. (Reynolds, 2014) &nbsp;Teens need to know that any amount of exercise is helpful and it is worth all the time they can give it. One way to teach teens about this is through Drake&rsquo;s P.E. program.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important part of P.E. is exercising regularly. P.E. is a large block of time 3 days a week that could make it much easier for teens to get regular exercise. This time is very valuable but a lot of it is being wasted. There is too much of a focus on learning things on paper and too little time devoted to the actual activity. In the recent ultimate frisbee unit students rarely actually played the game for more than ⅓ of the class. The rest of the time was spent changing into and out of uniforms, being instructed about the rules and techniques, and testing. Most people will never need to know the rules of ultimate frisbee and as long as they can throw the frisbee the technique does not matter. By spending time on these things students are missing out on the most important part, forming a habit of regular exercise.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake high school and the parents of teens need to change how they prioritize the importance of various aspects of teen&rsquo;s lives. Exercise needs to be a bigger part of every student's life. It has amazing benefits in both physical and mental health but they are not being taken advantage of. The workload of upperclassmen should be reduced to allow for students to care about their wellness in all aspects of their life. The P.E. program is a great opportunity to give students some of the exercise they need and teach them how to get exercise in their daily life but too much time is wasted. If we don&rsquo;t do something now we won&rsquo;t let teens live up to their full potential.</span></p>

                    <p class="lead">9th Grade - Congo Story Post Imperialism</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prologue</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year is 2015, 55 years after the Congo became independent from Belgium. The effects of imperialism are still affecting the congo every day. Just like King Leopold did long ago, big companies from all over the world exploit the Congo for minerals, cheap labor, and oil. As soon as the Belgians left, the country fell into disarray. The government does not have enough money to maintain the country properly and corruption is everywhere.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong><br /><br /><br /></strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am in the passenger seat of a Jeep bouncing along a dirt road about 25 miles out from the nearest town. The trees around me a bright green, greener than the trees near where I grew up in America. The dirt road beneath me has not been well maintained, and in the wet season roads often wash away when the rivers flood so we have to be careful. Today the wind is blowing to the west so the sky is clouded by the smog from where the forests are being burned down in a government program to clear space for farmland. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I yell to the driver over the roar of the wind in my ears &ldquo;How far away are we? I need to be there by 3:00.&rdquo; He replies in a strong accent &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost to the main road, its just a few minutes from there.&rdquo; If I don&rsquo;t make it on time this whole deal could fall through. I work for an American electronics company and I have been in the Congo for the last year looking at mines in the region to be our suppliers of rare minerals. My company sells to major electronics brands such as Apple and Samsung. I am on my way to inspect a mining site that we are looking to get a supply of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tantalum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later as we come around a turn I see someone in the road up ahead. The driver brings the car to an abrupt stop. The man in the road is wearing an official uniform and carrying a big gun. He and another man in a uniform walked up to the car and said &ldquo;Before you continue we need to check your documents&rdquo; The driver and I hand him our documents and hope that they will let us pass. But we are unlucky today and they say &ldquo;Your documents are not in order you will have to come with us.&rdquo; I hand one of the officers a ten thousand franc note or about ten dollars. They apologize for making us wait and we are on our way. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned quickly when I first arrived in the Congo that the authorities are so corrupt it is impossible to do any business without bribing many people. It is so hard to get permits for anything that virtually all businesses just break laws and pay bribes or hire guards to keep the police away. The police are so underpaid and understaffed that they would never take down a big company for working illegally.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Jeep rolled to a halt in front of the mining site. There are a few big concrete industrial buildings next to the big mining pit. The pit is stepped down into the ground and what I can see is as big as a football field. It is an open pit mine so there are no mineshafts going deep underground. The side of one hill is being gradually removed as the mine is dug out. The concrete buildings are simple but they are much more expensive than the common mud buildings in most of the towns.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pit is filled with thousands of workers from the surrounding villages. For many here it is the only source of work. The pay is a few dollars a day but it is better than what the workers get at other mines. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big man in a t-shirt strolls up to me and introduces himself as the owner of East Congo Mineral Holdings. "We produce the purest minerals for the best price" he said instinctively as we walked toward the concrete buildings. My driver is also the bodyguard hired by my company to protect me for my stay in the Congo so he accompanied me. Once inside we negotiated the price and how much minerals he could supply. I told him that I needed to inspect the working conditions of the workers in order to get approval from the company.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the thousands of workers in the pit were still working. There was no big machinery, all the mining was done by manual labor. I walked down into the pit avoiding muddy puddles in order to keep my shoes clean. I stopped by one of the workers and asked him about his job. He had a tired look in his eyes and was drenched in sweat from digging all day in the humid jungle. He replied in french so I had my driver translate for me he said "Every day I come here to work in the mines, it is hard work but I have no choice. There is no other work here, with the rebels destroying things every day and a government so corrupt no people come for tourism or invest and start a business. My father said that belgium is to blame. When we became independent belgium trashed everything and left us to fend for ourselves with no resources. People like you are no different you just take the resources you can and leave the country in ruins" </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course I already knew all about the history of the Congo but I had thought of me and my company as different. We were paying for the resources we took and provided jobs in a place with no work. But we did not pay taxes and almost every day there was a story in the news of people getting shot over the theft over a few grams of minerals. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is the end of the day and I have done a full survey of the mining site I am tired so I instruct my driver to drive me to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinshasa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for dinner. As we head towards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinshasa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thick forest subsides into a bustling city. We are approaching the Congo river, one of the biggest trade routes in the Congo. This river was once used by the colonists to ship rubber and ivory from the plantations deep in the forest to the ocean. Today it is still the only way to get to many remote places deep in the jungle. The houses around me are mostly made of mud brick with the occasional stone house of one of the wealthy residents. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pull up to the front of a cafe in the center of the city. I go inside and order dinner. I always come here because it is the only place within a hundred miles that has cell service. A few minutes into dinner and I hear a noise out in the street. People are yelling and chanting something. I get up to go out and see what the commotion is but my bodyguard tells me to wait. He steps outside into the bustling street. As they get closer I can start to make out what some people are saying. I hear someone yell &ldquo;Our land our minerals&rdquo;. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he is back a few minutes later he had a worried look on his face. He says loudly over the growing sound of chanting &ldquo;They are are protesting how they are being treated in the mines. They want a face to blame for all the trouble they are facing and you would be perfect. We have to get out of here!&rdquo; The restaurant is full and everyone is standing up, trying to figure out what is going on. My bodyguard pushes towards the back of the restaurant and takes me with him. We head for a side door to an alley off the main street. Outside we can see the protesters marching down the main street. We can&rsquo;t get to the Jeep in the front so we walk down the alley. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we turn the corner into another side street we hear a loud bang from back by the restaurant. Gunfire has started and the protests are now violent. My bodyguard pulls out his gun and we start sprinting in the opposite direction. A few blocks later we hear another shot BANG. Soon we hear the sound of sirens wailing as they rush towards the scene. When we are a safe distance away I pull out my satellite phone and call my company back in America to ask for assistance. A few minutes later we hear another siren this time coming straight towards us. When it gets here I see that it is a police car. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man gets out and say to us &ldquo;We are looking for the employees of East Congo Mineral Holdings&rdquo;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reply &ldquo;That's us, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We were sent by your company to get you out of here. I have been instructed to drive you to the capital, you will be safe there&rdquo;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get in the car and start driving towards the capital. I can finally breath normally and my heart rate slows down to normal.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day I am back at my house reading a newspaper from the UK. On the front page there is a story about the riot. The headline reads &ldquo;Thirty six killed in riot in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinshasa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;. In the article it explains that most of the casualties were from when the police opened fire on the protestors. Twenty one of the casualties were caused directly by the police. I also read a local newspaper and the riots were only briefly mentioned on the third page and there was no reference to the police being a cause of death. The government heavily censors all media before it can be published and the newspaper I read from the UK is not available here, I got it shipped specially for me. There is no internet in almost all of the Congo so there is no way for most people to get accurate accounts of any events. Because of all this most of the Congo will not even hear about any unrest and will not be able to help change.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I call up my company to explain to them what happened yesterday. I say that the Congo is too unstable to run any business from even with bodyguards and working with the police. They disagree and I get into a long argument with my boss. After a while we come to an agreement. I am going to to be transferred to another part of the world where I will be safer and someone else will come here to replace me. In a few weeks they will have a replacement ready and I can leave.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a few weeks later and I am on a plane. I am off to China to continue my work. I have heard rumors of a mining boom in the north of China but the government is trying to hide it to avoid scrutiny about mining practices from the rest of the word. I may be safer but almost everything else looks like it will be about the same. As long as there is money to be made powerful countries will always exploit the weak. Now I need to rest so I can don&rsquo;t have jet lag and can go to work tomorrow. </span></strong></p>

I think she is worried to add to Ama&rsquo;s many problems so she hides her fear and sorrow. The rain is both a relief and another source of fear, their hut may not withstand heavy rain in the winter. </span></p>

Is there any truth to this? This is such a provocative statement I think it will be important later in the book. It must be foreshadowing that Americans or other foreigners will help her escape.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mention of suicide connects this story to those in rich places such as where we live but still have high suicide rates. It also helps people grasp the severity of the situation they are in. By having the girl who committed suicide stay in Lakshmi&rsquo;s old room it connects her and brings her closer, showing she could easily been pushed to the same point.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any idea even if it seems very obviously untrue to the reader is believable to someone has had no information to contradict it. Throughout the book we learn low Lakshmi sees the world and what she thinks is going on around her. Lakshmi wants to use some of the money she earns to buy a gift for the tea boy instead of sending it all home and she learns the hard truth that her family is not getting any money. &ldquo;She laughs. &lsquo;You think the money goes home to your family?&rsquo; &rdquo; (238). We as readers know that there is no reason for Lakshmi&rsquo;s captors to send any money home but Lakshmi had no way of knowing this. From the time her step father sold her Lakshmi has been told that her family was getting paid this restricted her view of the world around her so she believed it was true. Another area where Lakshmi&rsquo;s ignorance is shown is when she thinks about america. &ldquo;But I do know, from this storybook that this America is a strange place. Everyone there is as rich as a king The birds there are big as men.&rdquo; (174). Logicly to most people it makes no sense that everyone is a king and that you should accept a story book as truth but Lakshmi has not been taught about america and she has no first hand experience so her ideas are formed by stories in a kid&rsquo;s book.</span></p>
                    <p class="lead">9th Grade - War Correspondents</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">War correspondents in Iraq can not conduct accurate reporting due to obstacles such as not being able to interact with the local community, violence targeted at reporters, and getting a skewed point of view by working too much with one side. Reporters tell the story of the world around them and if there are obstacles in their way this view can be very small and not reflect on what is really happening leading to inaccurate reporting. The opinions of the world including the people who make policy decisions are heavily influenced by the media so if the media is inaccurate it can have a huge impact on global politics.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a war correspondent is a dangerous job and many precautions are needed to keep journalists safe. Precautions such as always going out with an armed escort can lead to the reporters being disconnected from the community. Reporters can't talk to strangers and get first hand reports of wars because the risk is too high. Reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Farnaz Fassihi said "Being a foreign correspondent in Baghdad these days is like being under virtual house arrest." The safety of the reporters is not the only concern, it can be dangerous for locals to talk to westerners. If a local shares information with reporters they can become the targets of anyone who wants to keep their story quiet. Talking with an american can also be seen as betrayal of the country. because it is so hard to talk to the people actually affected by war the only source of information can sometimes be politicians with an agenda that give a very bias account of events.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another related issue that can influence reporting is the direct targeting of journalists in violent attacks. When reporters are being targeted they have to do even more than normal to stay safe. This often includes never leaving a hotel. If a reporter can never leave and report on what is really happening in the war they hardly are in a better position to report accurately than a journalist back at home. Sometimes even staying in a hotel all the time is not even enough, in 2004 an american photographer was seized by gunmen just outside his hotel. After that incident many journalists just left the war zone and returned home, it was just too dangerous. Without journalists in the warzone the only reports are from our military and the governments of foreign powers.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists are often embedded into military units so they can get close to the action but this can lead to more problems. When journalist are this close to the military they can only get the view of the one side they are with and lose their ability to do unbiased reporting. The views and reasons for fighting on the opposing side are lost and what is left is just the same as what a censored media would produce.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1: Country located in east africa and borders both ethiopia and kenya. Just south of the arabian peninsula. Touches indian ocean. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat plateaus throughout the country. Mountains in the south. </span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2: Geography, Climate - challenges it causes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Periodic monsoons, with dry humid gaps in between. Both droughts and floods common. 100% of electricity is generated by fossil fuels. Low CO2 emissions due to small size and poverty. Deforestation and desertification as a result of cutting trees for burning. Remote beaches have been used to dump toxic and nuclear waste.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economy, Culture - Divide between the educated and the poor. Somalia is incredibly poor It has the lowest gap per capita in the world. Urban areas are significantly more wealthy and people have access to non agricultural jobs. In rural areas often the only employment is physical labor and agriculture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clan leaders and some politicians hold a lot of power in their communities and typically live in rural areas.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4: Conflicts, civil war - who is fighting and why, what it means for normal people. Insurgent groups have been pushed way and weakened but there is still a lot of terrorist attacks. Living in a city where there are more jobs and schools </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5: Government - Parliament however not democratically elected, clan leaders in control. Who this benefits and who is left behind. President claims there will be democratic elections but always cancels before the next election.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define Childhood - Nathan:</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6)Child soldiers are a scary thought for us here in the United States but in Somalia it is often a get away for the kids that have been left on the streets by their poor parents who can't afford to keep them. The children are forced to Shine shoes for hours a day for money to buy food for themselves and even sibling and friends who have been left on the street as well.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7)They also scavenge for food in dumpsters and ask restaurants and local businesses if there is any extra food or leftovers before they get thrown away. Their other option is to turn to child soldiering where they will at least get some food and a roof over their heads instead of living on the side of the road in a box.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8)Seeing homeless children is common because there are an estimated 4,000 street kids in just the capital Mogadishu alone. Which means that the number is much larger for the entire country which puts a lot of pressure on restaurants and local businesses because often these kids are trying to get food from them so they can have a meal before they find a place sleep.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9) often you find large groups of boys packing themselves into small rooms to huddle around small tv&rsquo;s which is a pastime that's helped these boys enjoy some time off the streets</span></p>
                    <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10) Somali children find themselves working in fields harvesting the available crops for multiple hours a day or asking people for work or money just to make enough to feed themselves</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters/ Conclusion/ What should be done -Sebastian</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">16: investment in education- The few that have an opportunity to get a good education are living a relatively nice live compared to the rest of somalia. The government needs to act and spend much more on education especially in rural areas so those children can have an equal start at greatness in their lives.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17: Democratic elections - In order for the voice of the people to start change they need power in the government. The government will not act in the interests of its people if they are never held accountable. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">18: Joy - Children in somalia will never be able to experience the complete joy of childhood until they are out of extreme poverty. They do not need to live in riches but once they have enough to stop working from a very young age they can start bringing much more joy into their lives. They will have time to play with a makeshift soccer ball in an empty field.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">19: Everyone has a right to this joy as a child but too many don&rsquo;t. In such a war torn and poverty stricken country even amazing governmental leadership it will be a long time before conditions improve significantly. There needs to be a large effort from the international community including large investment in the country that could have huge potential.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20: Conclude - It is our duty as fellow citizens on this planet to help each other and blah blah blah. Thank you</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I met all the benchmarks on time however the first research benchmark was not my best work. I mostly just answered the questions without looking at the bigger picture. Next time to help with this I need to make sure to read over the driving questions as I am doing the research so I don&rsquo;t loose focus. By completing the benchmarks on time I never fell behind making it much more easy to complete the final project in high quality and not just rush it at the end.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Seeking Feedback</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was always ready to seek feedback from my team members and my teachers. This ensured that my final project was high quality. I read all the feedback about my work on echo and used it to improve on the next benchmark. We were rushing to finish our script and practice so we never got a chance to get feedback from another team. I think this would have been helpful.</span></strong><br /><br /></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did I use agency today?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all the stations I monitored my own learning so I could improve my work. I got and gave good feedback in the peer editing workshop. I had trouble keeping with journalistic style in my first draft so in the writing workshop I read some news articles and started revising my article to better match the style. I could turn in my final draft now but I could improve a lot and I will do that before friday. I am very good at learning on my own if it is a topic I am interested in, I can research from reliable sources well. Sometimes I procrastinate and have to do too much in a few nights.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grows from setbacks: This is a long project with many parts at some time there will be a setback. I need to learn to use these setbacks to my advantage and grow as a student. my first outline for this project did not have a clear focus and I had to mostly redo it but this made my writing much better.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meets benchmarks: In a project like this if you fall behind on one part it can be easy to be late on the whole project that is why it is important to meet benchmarks. I am on track to have my rough draft done today.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uses effort to grow and improve: Even the best at anything can always improve in this project that means making many drafts and revising. I always put effort into my writing but sometimes when I already have a high grade but I know i can do better I don't do the extra work.</span></p>
