            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Smart Irrigation Timer</h3>
              <p>
                Last year I entered in a competition run by Samsung called Makers Against Drought. The goal was to help reduce the impact of the drought using the internet of things. Samsung provided each entrant with a Samsung ARTIK development board to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                My entry was a smart irrigation timer that changes the watering schedule based on the weather. It was designed to work with existing irrigation systems, just replacing the main valve controller. The Samsung dev board had an Arduino like interface so it was relatively easy to interface with some relays to control the valves. There was only simple software that triggered the relays based on a schedule given by an api running on the samsung device, the most important piece was the cloud api it got its daily schedule from. The cloud service gets its data from the California Department of Water Resources’ California Irrigation Management Information System (they like concise and memorable names). That system provides raw daily rainfall and evapotranspiration data. I normalized that data to percentage value compared to a very hot summer day so I could apply it to the user’s schedule.  This method works without asking them to input lots of data they probably don’t know such as the type of soil, hours of sun per day, and irrigation system flow rate per square foot.
              </p>
              <p>
                My system won me an honorable mention in the competition, beating many people with impressive degrees and years of experience in the field. The honorable mention came with a prize of $2000. After the contest was over, I continued to work on the project. I realized that Samsung's device was hugely overpowered resulting in a overly complex and expensive system. I am now working on a new version with the esp8266 chip as my main controller. The esp8266 is a $1.80 chip that replaces the ~$100 chip provided by Samsung. With this change I think I will be able to finish it with only around $15 in parts.
              </p>
            <h3>Machine Learning Style Detection</h3>
              <p>
                My only experience with machine learning so far was inspired by an april fools joke. This year Google announced their cloud vision api and a couple of months later on April fools day announced a new fake product “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4l6TwhVAHo">Style Detection for Cloud Vision</a>”. This summer I was looking for another project to work on and I wanted to learn some machine learning so I decided to make it in real life. I followed a tutorial to re train Google’s inception image classifier with my own images. I categorized a few hundred photos from the web and ran the retraining script. When it was done the model was able to correctly identify between bohemian, chic, normcore, hiphop, hipster, normcore, and preppy with an accuracy of 57.0%. This is not great but there were 6 categories and more importantly the grouping of styles is very subjective.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think if I put more time into finding good training images and properly sorting them into categories I could improve the accuracy. I also should mess with the training config some more to see if that helps with the accuracy. Finding a good dataset was hard and I ended up with just the top results from a Google image search, looking closely at the image folders I can see several examples of miscategorized images.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometime in the future, when I have more time I would like to do something with this idea. I could see it being built into an app or a website where you can take a photo or upload an image, have it labeled by the algorithm, and share it on social media. In this use case the accuracy is not very important it just needs to be good enough to have some entertainment value. I think it could also be a valuable addition to the online stores of clothing retailers. It could help group items to form “looks” marketable to a certain group of people. I think this could provide better recommendations than simply comparing similar purchases.
              </p>
            <h3>Online School Grades</h3>
              <p>
                When I started high school, I was introduced to the system that lets students view their grades online. It kind of worked but had many problems. It did not work on phones, the predominant way we access the internet. The user interface was ugly and did show the most important information, your grade in the class, unless you clicked a tiny button in the corner. People were constantly complaining to the teachers and administrators about it problems but there was little they could do, it is run by a independent company that hugely overcharged the school and provides bad customer service. I decided to fix this problem, so I created an alternative website that displays the grades with good ui, ux and mobile support. The site worked by scraping the data from the original website, parsing the data with python and sending it to the new site. The site grew hugely popular through word of mouth at my school and got 400 users daily out of my school of 1000 people.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it got more popular the some of the teachers started to hear about it and one talked to the administrators about it. The administration decided that is was a privacy risk and blocked my access to the home access servers. They were concerned that I could be stealing people’s grades or passwords, but this had no basis in reality all the code is publicly available on github. I was willing to work with the school IT department but they did not want to so I was forced to shut down.
              </p>
              <p>
                The block gave me an opportunity to improve my system because to get it online I was forced to rebuild it from scratch. I simplified the layout even more showing the most important information clearly at the top, removed unnecessary animations, and changed the font and colors for even better legibility and appearance. I also had to move to a new provider to get around the block so I simplified and optimized the server code for maximum speed. The new version is now live and works well but I have not publicized it, I do not want to risk it being taken down again. For now it is just for me.
              </p>
            <h3>More later...</h3>
              <p>
                I will add more projects I have done in the future but I don't have any time right now. For now more projects are avalible on <a href="https://github.com/sebastianboyd">Github</a>
